            <h2>About Pinnacle</h2>
            <p> From its founding in 1929, the Pinnacle Hotel has had a long history 
                of cultural, historical, and architectural integrity. When Alfonsino De
                 Ratatouille started Pinnacle, he had one goal in mind: to provide the best 
                 genuine italian vacation experience to its customers. Ever since its 
                 humble beginnings back in 1929, the Pinnacle Hotel has truly become 
                 the pinnacle in the hotel business—with its unrivaled pools, sprawling 
                 rooms, and cozy suites, Pinnacle is the best in the west. Thousands 
                 flock from all over the world to have a chance to experience what people have called the “best hotel experience ever.”

            <h2>Our Legacy</h2>
            <p>For generations, the De Rossi family worked as humble farmers
               in the italian suburbs. The great famine of 1923 deprived the 
               fields of hydration, and the olive farmers of their harvests. 
               determined to save his family's financial situation a few years later, Alfosino 
               convinced his wife to turn their shed into a small hotel and bar
               for the locals. As word spread and the olive trees shriveled, 
               Pinnacle became the primary attraction in the village. Months later, 
               Ferrari automobiles lined the dirt path leading into the resort. 
               Since then, the hotel has become an international attraction, sustained
               by the hands of later De Ratatouille generations.
